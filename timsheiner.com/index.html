				<p class="lead">I was the initial design hire at a Big Data start up where I built a design studio that that included 3 fulltime staff and 2 contractors. We executed all design work for product, data visualization, brand and marketing. I was a player/coach providing the founders with UX strategy, recruiting and mentoring my team, making hands on contributions to programming language syntax, designing application experiences and making prototypes, both click-through and in code.</p>

					<h1>Vision &amp; Process</h1>

				<p class="lead">I joined GE's Predix platform project to develop a UX strategy and design for specific scrum team as well as create a process for integrating UX and Agile that could be exported to other scrum teams within the organization. </p>
					<p class="lead">I exceeded expectations at this assignment by focusing first on gaining the trust of the software manager and developers on the team through my understanding of the technical details of software development.  From this position of credibility I was able to inject a long term vision and structured, repeatable user-centered methods into all stages of their Agile cycle. I consolidated the value I had introduced by mentoring a young designer on the team to be able to drive the vision and the Agile/UX integration process I had developed. Other scrum teams observed the positive outcomes of the pilot and began requesting dedicated UX support.</p>

				<p class="lead">Our first tiny grant paid for a party in the park to bring the community together around our needs. Signatures gathered at the party established credibility with a private foundation who gave us enough money to sponsor a design competition for the park.</p>
