                            <p class="lead">Union is a commercial open source play founded by the creators of the <a href="https://flyte.org">Flyte</a> orchestration platform. What I found when I arrived was a truly great orchestration platform hidden behind two (!) inconsistent CLIs and an awkward, unattractive GUI.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I began two initiatives to fix this, one tactical, the other more strategic.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Step 1 - Quick UI Refresh</h3>
                            <p>To communicate quickly to our customers that Union had a new focus on user experience, I initiated a UI refresh with 4 objectives:
                                </p><ul>
                                    <li>improve the visual appearance and bring it inline with <i>de facto</i> developer console standards</li>
                                    <li>align the product branding with the marketing website</li>
                                    <li>improve accessibility and navigation with a standard page header and breadcrumbs on every page</li>
                                    <li>remove unnecessary whitespace</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When we released these changes half of the existing customers reached out unsolicited to communicate their delight with the changes!</p>
                                    
                                <div class="bezel screen"><img src="img/union_before.png"><p class="caption">Union UI before the refresh.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="bezel screen">
                                
                                <img src="img/union_after.png"><p class="caption">Union UI after the refresh</p>
                                </div>
                                
                            <h3>Step 2 - Create a Vision</h3>
                            <p>My more strategic initiative was to develop a product vision. The product team was focused on adding features as fast as possible but lacked even the most basic narrative about target users and their needs.There was no framework for prioritizing one feature idea over another or any structured plan for how the new features fit together into a useful experience.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, simultaneously with managing the GUI refresh, I created a UX Vision for Union in about 8 weeks.</p> 
                            <p>While I cannot show here slides from my actual strategic presentation, I've created schematic stand ins to walk you through the process I used to create an actionable, validated UX vision for Union.</p>

                            <p>The delivery of these assets marked the end of my Union story. The company founders were pleased with my strategic work, but unwilling to implement the <a href="https://medium.com/the-effective-designer/this-is-how-product-development-works-95109dcf065d">the way of working</a> that had been part of my hiring conversation. I wish the team the best and am grateful for the learning about distributed systems, Kubernetes and orchestration workflows I gained during my time with them.</p>

                            <img class="logo" src="img/logo_salesforce.png">
                            <p class="lead">During 6 years at Salesforce I worked in a variety of areas from Design Systems to IoT to Developer Experience. Below are case studies for two of the many projects I worked on.</p>
                            <h3>DevOps Center</h3>
                            <p>This project had two customer benefits. First, it replaced a much maligned feature called "Change Sets" that had been the only way declarative developers on the Saleforce platform could manage changes. Second, it enabled declarative and programmatic developers to collaborate on projects--something previously not possible natively on the platform--via git and a shared code repository.</p>
                            <p>I facilitated the initial framing of the project by developing a model for DeeDee, our declarative developer persona, and then using collaborative whiteboarding sessions to create product narratives with product and engineering partners.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">
                                <img src="img/salesforce_persona.png"><p class="caption">DeeDee was created by combining new interviews with existing research.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">
                                 <img src="img/salesforce_whiteboarding.png"><p class="caption">Shared story telling gets stakeholders on the same page</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Through our framing work it became clear we needed to make "projects" a first class object in the Salesforce system. I created a presentation to communicate the value of this concept and evangelized it with executive stakeholders.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">
                                
                                <img src="img/salesforce_projects.png"><p class="caption">Prior to DevOps Center, declarative developers had no way to organize work into projects</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>To help ensure that design, product and engineering partners where thinking about the the technical challenges in the same way, I visualized through time the synchronization between the GUI we were building for DeeDee, the CLI commands that Pedro, her programmatic developer partner would be using and the underlying git branch model.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">
                                <img src="img/salesforce_doce_events.png">

                            </div>

                            <p>I visualized all of the product workflows to ensure we were considering all happy path and error transitions.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">

                            </div>
                            <p>I championed the "work item" as the central organizing principle for DevOps Center in order to provide DeeDee with an intuitive way to begin understanding the standard Agile model of software development. The work item then became a tangible way to represent the creation and movement of changes through the system.</p>

                            <p>To harmonize the work of several platfrom teams I developed a standard UX model for monitoring.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Jut was a streaming data start up. Our vision was "easy data visualization for DevOps." I was hire #7, or something really early like that, brought in to create and lead a design function from scratch for a team of ambitious founders who already represented the executive, product and engineering leadership. I owned the UX strategy for Jut, created our design system and built a small but mighty design team that produced a beautifully integrated brand, marketing and product user experience.</p>

                            <p class="lead">As a company we made a critical start up mistake and flamed out after only two years, however, those years were some of the most interesting of my career.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Here's the story.</p>
                            <h3>A Solid Discovery Process</h3>
                            <p>The Jut business startegy was to serve the DevOps market with tooling for monitoring and troubleshooting production software installations.
                            </p>
                            <p>Things began, as they should in product development, by trying to understand our target users. Employing a variety of research techniques such as 1:1 interviews, attending DevOps trade shows and reading community
                                blogs I led the founders through the process of creating personas.</p>
                            <div class="flex-container bezel illustration">
                                
                                <img src="img/jut_kyle.png"><p class="caption">I drove the research and development of Kyle, our primary persona.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>I helped the founders structure their DevOps vision by introducing them to the notion of "design by story telling," using both text and visual formats.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">
                                <p class="caption">Every design begins with a story. </p>
                                <div class="wrapper">
                                    <div class="flex-item"><img src="img/jut_kyle-story.png"></div>
                                    <div class="flex-item"><img src="img/jut_whiteboard-workflow.png"></div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>These promising beginnings led to a collaboration with a CDN provider as a design partner. This relationship resulted in a well received prototype that gave Kyle a visual overview of all the event traffic on his
                                network, combined with a simple mechanism for filtering to the events coming from particular logical or physical nodes during a particular time window. Kyle (that is, real people like persona Kyle) thought it
                                was a great tool for rapidly locating problem spots when troubleshooting network issues.</p>
                            <h3>The Mistake</h3>
                            <p>The next step after our successful initial prototyping experience was to begin creating our actual first product. This produced an intense debate about which of three different application styles to pursue:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>an <b>IDE</b>, like a programmer would use</li>
                                <li>a <b>Notebook</b>, like a data scientist would use</li>
                                <li>a <b>Data Explorer</b>, most like the prototype, that was primarily a diagnostic tool, navigated by searching &amp; filtering
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The source of this conflict came from the tension between developing an application or a platform. We'd prototyped and tested an application for Kyle but the founders the real value would come from building a platform
                                based on a new programming language they would create, to be called Juttle, with syntax optimized for analyzing, visualizing and alerting on streaming data at scale.</p>
                            <p>To visualize the options I organized a sketching session where I asked 3 teams to sketch the same 6 steps in a workflow, but using 3 different interaction models. The result was an "apples to apples to apples" visual
                                comparison of the different strategies.</p>
                            <div class="flex-container bezel illustration">
                                <p class="caption">Three versions of the same story.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>And here the team made a critical, and classic, mistake: the decision was to create an experience, midway between an IDE and a Notebook, that would be most useful to our internal team that needed a tool to write,
                                test and debug the new syntax they were creating.</p>
                            <h3>Mine is not to wonder why&hellip;</h3>
                            <p>At this point I had personal doubts about our product strategy but I loved the team, the culture and knew that given the size of our war chest, worst case it'd be at least two years before I had to look for a new
                                job so I accepted the executive call and began to wireframe key workflows.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately, none of this great work could make up for the fact that a product strategy of "you need to learn a new programming language" was a non-starter. Juttle was amazing, but because of the time that had
                                to be invested to understand this, very few people actually tried our product.</p>
                            <h3>Once again, with feeling!</h3>
                            <p>My response was to go back to the beginning and make the case for creating a productized version of the search-based diagnostic experience we'd prototyped originally. I took on the role of product manager, and wrote
                                a product brief complete with hi-res wireframes.</p>
                            <div class="bezel illustration">

                            </div>
                            <p>On the strength of this proposal I got one engineering resources to help me build an MVP. Interestingly the "platform" strategy showed its strength because using only Juttle and the Jut design system we were able
                                to create a functional application extremely quickly.</p>

                            <p>When I took this out for user testing the response was great. Sadly, we had begun this pivot too late. Out of money and time, Jut was shut down after 2 years, pretty much exactly matching my worst case prediction.</p>
                            <p>Overall Jut was a wonderful experience, one that created great friendships, exposed me to fascinating technology, gave me a chance to grow as a design leader and will go down as the proudest failure of my career.</p>
