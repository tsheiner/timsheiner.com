					<p class="lead">I am a thoughtful, hands on product designer who can conceive, architect, and grow a product as well as recruit, mentor and develop a team.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">My passion is operationalizing design. I help organizations ship great and cost-effective user experiences by championing design standards, platform infrastructure, and the application of simple, effective design practices.
					</p>
					
					<p class="lead">I succeed as a leader because trust is my highest priority. I do what I say I will do; I listen carefully to all project stakeholders and I am fearless about asking questions until we are all on the same page. I always have a plan for the way forward, but also a keen sense for when the best outcome will come from clearing space and stepping back so others can lead.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">As a strategist I excel because I use system thinking to see around corners and identify the most effective leverage points for change. I deliver innovation efficiently by focussing my team’s creative energy on what actually needs to be innovated and using standards and pre-existing solutions for everything else.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">My personal design process combines user research, systems thinking and iterative prototyping to develop straightforward solutions to user needs. I’ve refined my approach across the verticals of e-commerce, financial services, pharmaceuticals, and cloud infrastructure.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">I am currently looking for work with a purpose-driven organization.</p>

From this position of credibility I was able to inject a long term vision and structured, repeatable user-centered methods into all stages of their Agile cycle. I consolidated the value I had introduced by mentoring a young designer on the team to be able to drive the vision and the Agile/UX integration process I had developed. Other scrum teams observed the positive outcomes of the pilot and began requesting dedicated UX support.</p>				</div>
