                                        <p class="lead">Jut was a streaming data start up. Our vision was "easy data visualization for DevOps." I was hire #7, or something really early like that, brought in to create and lead a design function from scratch for a team
                                            of ambitious founders who already represented the executive, product and engineering leadership. I owned the UX strategy for Jut, created our design system and built a small but mighty design team that produced
                                            a beautifully integrated brand, marketing and product user experience.</p>

                                        <p class="lead">As a company we made a critical start up mistake and flamed out after only two years, however, those years were some of the most interesting of my career.</p>
                                        <p class="lead">Here's the story.</p>
                                        <h3>A Solid Discovery Process</h3>
                                        <p class="lead">The Jut business startegy was to serve the DevOps market with tooling for monitoring and troubleshooting production software installations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="lead">Things began, as they should in product development, by trying to understand our target users. Employing a variety of research techniques such as 1:1 interviews, attending DevOps trade shows and reading community
                                            blogs I led the founders through the process of creating personas.</p>
                                        <div class="flex-container bezel illustration">
                                            <p class="caption">I drove the research and development of Kyle, our primary persona.
                                            </p>
                                            <img src="img/jut_kyle.png">
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="lead">I helped the founders structure their DevOps vision by introducing them to the notion of "design by story telling," using both text and visual formats.</p>
                                        <div class="bezel illustration">
                                            <p class="caption">Every design begins with a story. </p>
                                            <div class="wrapper">
                                                <div class="flex-item"><img src="img/jut_kyle-story.png"></div>

                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="lead">These promising beginnings led to a collaboration with a CDN provider as a design partner. This relationship resulted in a well received prototype that gave Kyle a visual overview of all the event traffic on his
                                            network, combined with a simple mechanism for filtering to the events coming from particular logical or physical nodes during a particular time window. Kyle (that is, real people like persona Kyle) thought it
                                            was a great tool for rapidly locating problem spots when troubleshooting network issues.</p>
                                        <h3>The Mistake</h3>
                                        <p class="lead">The next step after our successful initial prototyping experience was to begin creating our actual first product. This produced an intense debate about which of three different application styles to pursue:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>an <b>IDE</b>, like a programmer would use</li>
                                            <li>a <b>Notebook</b>, like a data scientist would use</li>
                                            <li>a <b>Data Explorer</b>, most like the prototype, that was primarily a diagnostic tool, navigated by searching & filtering
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="lead">The source of this conflict came from the tension between developing an application or a platform. We'd prototyped and tested an application for Kyle but the founders the real value would come from building a platform
                                            based on a new programming language they would create, to be called Juttle, with syntax optimized for analyzing, visualizing and alerting on streaming data at scale.</p>
                                        <p class="lead">To visualize the options I organized a sketching session where I asked 3 teams to sketch the same 6 steps in a workflow, but using 3 different interaction models. The result was an "apples to apples to apples" visual
                                            comparison of the different strategies.</p>
                                        <div class="flex-container bezel illustration">

                                        <p class="lead">And here the team made a critical, and classic, mistake: the decision was to create an experience, midway between an IDE and a Notebook, that would be most useful to our internal team that needed a tool to write,
                                            test and debug the new syntax they were creating.</p>
                                        <h3>Mine is not to wonder why…</h3>
                                        <p class="lead">At this point I had personal doubts about our product strategy but I loved the team, the culture and knew that given the size of our war chest, worst case it'd be at least two years before I had to look for a new
                                            job so I accepted the executive call and began to wireframe key workflows.</p>

                                            to be invested to understand this, very few people actually tried our product.</p>

                                        <p class="lead">My response was to go back to the beginning and make the case for creating a productized version of the search-based diagnostic experience we'd prototyped originally. I took on the role of product manager, and wrote
                                            a product brief complete with hi-res wireframes.</p>

                                            to create a functional application extremely quickly.</p>

                                        <p class="lead">Overall Jut was a wonderful experience, one that created great friendships, exposed me to fascinating technology, gave me a chance to grow as a design leader and will go down as the proudest failure of my career.</p>
